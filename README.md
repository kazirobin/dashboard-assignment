## 🧱 Folder Overview

### `components/layouts`

Defines your **MainLayout** (Navbar + Sidebar + Outlet).
All routes share this layout for a consistent design.

### `components/shared`

Contains reusable shared UI components such as:

* `DynamicButton`
* `Navbar`
* `Sidebar`
* `Table` (with pagination and fixed column width **processing** )
* `Icon`

### `components/pages`

Contains the main views:

* **Home** – Dashboard overview
* **Products** – Product listing, editing, and pagination
* **Users** – User management page

### `data`

Holds static JSON or JS data files:

* `products.data.jsx` – Product list data
* `sidebar.data.jsx` – Sidebar items configuration

### `router/routes.jsx`

* All routes are defined here.
* MainLayout wraps around all page routes.

---

## 🧮 Form Handling

All forms are built using **Formik** with:

* Input validation
* Error handling
* Controlled form state
* Update/Edit functionality for products

---

## 🧭 Routing Example

```jsx
import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import MainLayout from "../components/layouts/MainLayout";
import Home from "../components/pages/home/Home";
import Products from "../components/pages/products/Products";
import Users from "../components/pages/users/Users";

export const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <MainLayout />,
    children: [
      { path: "/", element: <Home /> },
      { path: "/products", element: <Products /> },
      { path: "/users", element: <Users /> },
    ],
  },
]);
```

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

* Ensure all components follow the same **naming convention** and **folder structure**.
* Use **Formik** for new forms to maintain validation consistency.
